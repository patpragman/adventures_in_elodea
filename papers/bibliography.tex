Abstract      = {Deep Learning has pushed the limits of what was possible in the domain of
Digital Image Processing. However, that is not to say that the traditional
computer vision techniques which had been undergoing progressive development in
years prior to the rise of DL have become obsolete. This paper will analyse the
benefits and drawbacks of each approach. The aim of this paper is to promote a
discussion on whether knowledge of classical computer vision techniques should
be maintained. The paper will also explore how the two sides of computer vision
can be combined. Several recent hybrid methodologies are reviewed which have
demonstrated the ability to improve computer vision performance and to tackle
problems not suited to Deep Learning. For example, combining traditional
computer vision techniques with Deep Learning has been popular in emerging
domains such as Panoramic Vision and 3D vision for which Deep Learning models
have not yet been fully optimised},

Abstract      = {Real-time tracking is an important problem in computer vision in which most
methods are based on the conventional cameras. Neuromorphic vision is a concept
defined by incorporating neuromorphic vision sensors such as silicon retinas in
vision processing system. With the development of the silicon technology,
asynchronous event-based silicon retinas that mimic neuro-biological
architectures has been developed in recent years. In this work, we combine the
vision tracking algorithm of computer vision with the information encoding
mechanism of event-based sensors which is inspired from the neural rate coding
mechanism. The real-time tracking of single object with the advantage of high
speed of 100 time bins per second is successfully realized. Our method
demonstrates that the computer vision methods could be used for the
neuromorphic vision processing and we can realize fast real-time tracking using
neuromorphic vision sensors compare to the conventional camera.},

Abstract      = {Advancements in deep learning have ignited an explosion of research on
efficient hardware for embedded computer vision. Hardware vision acceleration,
however, does not address the cost of capturing and processing the image data
that feeds these algorithms. We examine the role of the image signal processing
(ISP) pipeline in computer vision to identify opportunities to reduce
computation and save energy. The key insight is that imaging pipelines should
be designed to be configurable: to switch between a traditional photography
mode and a low-power vision mode that produces lower-quality image data
suitable only for computer vision. We use eight computer vision algorithms and
a reversible pipeline simulation tool to study the imaging system's impact on
vision performance. For both CNN-based and classical vision algorithms, we
observe that only two ISP stages, demosaicing and gamma compression, are
critical for task performance. We propose a new image sensor design that can
compensate for skipping these stages. The sensor design features an adjustable
resolution and tunable analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Our proposed
imaging system's vision mode disables the ISP entirely and configures the
sensor to produce subsampled, lower-precision image data. This vision mode can
save ~75% of the average energy of a baseline photography mode while having
only a small impact on vision task accuracy.},

Abstract      = {Foundation models or pre-trained models have substantially improved the
performance of various language, vision, and vision-language understanding
tasks. However, existing foundation models can only perform the best in one
type of tasks, namely language, vision, or vision-language. It is still an open
question whether it is possible to construct a foundation model performing the
best for all the understanding tasks, which we call a general foundation model.
In this paper, we propose a new general foundation model, X-FM (the
X-Foundation Model). X-FM has one language encoder, one vision encoder, and one
fusion encoder, as well as a new training method. The training method includes
two new techniques for learning X-FM from text, image, and image-text pair
data. One is to stop gradients from the vision-language training when learning
the language encoder. The other is to leverage the vision-language training to
guide the learning of the vision encoder. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets show that X-FM can significantly outperform existing general
foundation models and perform better than or comparable to existing foundation
models specifically for language, vision, or vision-language understanding.},

Abstract      = {Retinal degenerative diseases cause profound visual impairment in more than

restore vision to these individuals. Analogous to cochlear implants, these
devices electrically stimulate surviving retinal cells to evoke visual percepts

rudimentary. Rather than aiming to restore "natural" vision, there is potential
merit in borrowing state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms as image
processing techniques to maximize the usefulness of prosthetic vision. Here we
combine deep learning--based scene simplification strategies with a
psychophysically validated computational model of the retina to generate
realistic predictions of simulated prosthetic vision, and measure their ability
to support scene understanding of sighted subjects (virtual patients) in a
variety of outdoor scenarios. We show that object segmentation may better
support scene understanding than models based on visual saliency and monocular
depth estimation. In addition, we highlight the importance of basing
theoretical predictions on biologically realistic models of phosphene shape.
Overall, this work has the potential to drastically improve the utility of
prosthetic vision for people blinded from retinal degenerative diseases.},

that traditional image anonymization substantially impacts final model

continuous vision applications. We co-design a mobile System-on-a-Chip (SoC)

architectural augmentation is to co-optimize different SoC IP blocks in the
vision pipeline collectively. Specifically, we propose to expose the motion
data that is naturally generated by the Image Signal Processor (ISP) early in
the vision pipeline to the CNN engine. Measurement and synthesis results show
that Euphrates achieves up to 66% SoC-level energy savings (4 times for the
vision computations), with only 1% accuracy loss.},

Despite the significant developments in algorithms for consensus maximisation,
there has been a lack of fundamental analysis of the problem in the computer
vision literature. In particular, whether consensus maximisation is "tractable"
remains a question that has not been rigorously dealt with, thus making it
difficult to assess and compare the performance of proposed algorithms,

Abstract      = {Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that can learn a
global or personalized model from decentralized datasets on edge devices.
However, in the computer vision domain, model performance in FL is far behind
centralized training due to the lack of exploration in diverse tasks with a
unified FL framework. FL has rarely been demonstrated effectively in advanced
computer vision tasks such as object detection and image segmentation. To
bridge the gap and facilitate the development of FL for computer vision tasks,
in this work, we propose a federated learning library and benchmarking
framework, named FedCV, to evaluate FL on the three most representative
computer vision tasks: image classification, image segmentation, and object
detection. We provide non-I.I.D. benchmarking datasets, models, and various
reference FL algorithms. Our benchmark study suggests that there are multiple
challenges that deserve future exploration: centralized training tricks may not
be directly applied to FL; the non-I.I.D. dataset actually downgrades the model
accuracy to some degree in different tasks; improving the system efficiency of
federated training is challenging given the huge number of parameters and the
per-client memory cost. We believe that such a library and benchmark, along
with comparable evaluation settings, is necessary to make meaningful progress

the efficient match of the representation with the statistics of natural
scenes. Applying such a paradigm to computer vision therefore seems a promising
approach towards more biomimetic algorithms. Herein, we will describe a
biologically-inspired approach to this problem. First, we will describe an
unsupervised learning paradigm which is particularly adapted to the efficient
coding of image patches. Then, we will outline a complete multi-scale framework

Abstract      = {Computer vision produces representations of scene content. Much computer
vision research is predicated on the assumption that these intermediate
representations are useful for action. Recent work at the intersection of
machine learning and robotics calls this assumption into question by training
sensorimotor systems directly for the task at hand, from pixels to actions,
with no explicit intermediate representations. Thus the central question of our
work: Does computer vision matter for action? We probe this question and its
offshoots via immersive simulation, which allows us to conduct controlled
reproducible experiments at scale. We instrument immersive three-dimensional
environments to simulate challenges such as urban driving, off-road trail
traversal, and battle. Our main finding is that computer vision does matter.
Models equipped with intermediate representations train faster, achieve higher
task performance, and generalize better to previously unseen environments. A

including offensive prediction results and lower performance for

using datasets consisting of manually annotated images or videos; the data and
label distributions in these datasets are critical to the models' behavior. In
this paper, we examine ImageNet, a large-scale ontology of images that has
spurred the development of many modern computer vision methods. We consider
three key factors within the "person" subtree of ImageNet that may lead to
problematic behavior in downstream computer vision technology: (1) the stagnant
concept vocabulary of WordNet, (2) the attempt at exhaustive illustration of
all categories with images, and (3) the inequality of representation in the
images within concepts. We seek to illuminate the root causes of these concerns
and take the first steps to mitigate them constructively.},

Abstract      = {Computer vision is often performed using Convolutional Neural Networks

power-contrained systems such as mobile and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices.
CNNs are compute-intensive because they indiscriminately compute many features
on all pixels of the input image. We observe that, given a computer vision
task, images often contain pixels that are irrelevant to the task. For example,
if the task is looking for cars, pixels in the sky are not very useful.
Therefore, we propose that a CNN be modified to only operate on relevant pixels
to save computation and energy. We propose a method to study three popular
computer vision datasets, finding that 48% of pixels are irrelevant. We also
propose the focused convolution to modify a CNN's convolutional layers to
reject the pixels that are marked irrelevant. On an embedded device, we observe
no loss in accuracy, while inference latency, energy consumption, and
multiply-add count are all reduced by about 45%.},

To aid with determining which embedded platform is most suitable for their

for why a given underlying hardware architecture innately performs well or
poorly based on the characteristics of a range of vision kernel categories.
Specifically, our study is performed for three commonly used HW accelerators
for embedded vision applications: ARM57 CPU, Jetson TX2 GPU and ZCU102 FPGA,
using their vendor optimized vision libraries: OpenCV, VisionWorks and
xfOpenCV. Our results show that the GPU achieves an energy/frame reduction
ratio of 1.1-3.2x compared to the others for simple kernels. While for more
complicated kernels and complete vision pipelines, the FPGA outperforms the
others with energy/frame reduction ratios of 1.2-22.3x. It is also observed
that the FPGA performs increasingly better as a vision application's pipeline

Abstract      = {Quantization is one of the most effective methods to compress neural
networks, which has achieved great success on convolutional neural networks

computer vision. However, previous post-training quantization methods performed
not well on vision transformer, resulting in more than 1% accuracy drop even in
8-bit quantization. Therefore, we analyze the problems of quantization on
vision transformers. We observe the distributions of activation values after
softmax and GELU functions are quite different from the Gaussian distribution.
We also observe that common quantization metrics, such as MSE and cosine
distance, are inaccurate to determine the optimal scaling factor. In this
paper, we propose the twin uniform quantization method to reduce the
quantization error on these activation values. And we propose to use a Hessian
guided metric to evaluate different scaling factors, which improves the
accuracy of calibration at a small cost. To enable the fast quantization of
vision transformers, we develop an efficient framework, PTQ4ViT. Experiments
show the quantized vision transformers achieve near-lossless prediction
accuracy (less than 0.5% drop at 8-bit quantization) on the ImageNet

convolutional neural networks. A convolution with padding outputs the data of
the same shape as the input data; therefore, it is necessary to prove whether a
convolutional neural network composed of convolutions can approximate such a
function. We have shown that convolutional neural networks can approximate
continuous functions whose input and output values have the same shape. In
addition, the minimum depth of the neural network required for approximation
was presented, and we proved that it is the optimal value. We also verified
that convolutional neural networks with sufficiently deep layers have
universality when the number of channels is limited.},

Abstract      = {The convolution operation is a central building block of neural network
architectures widely used in computer vision. The size of the convolution
kernels determines both the expressiveness of convolutional neural networks

capacity to capture rich pixel relationships requires increasing the number of
learnable parameters, often leading to overfitting and/or lack of robustness.
In this paper, we propose a powerful novel building block, the
hyper-convolution, which implicitly represents the convolution kernel as a
function of kernel coordinates. Hyper-convolutions enable decoupling the kernel
size, and hence its receptive field, from the number of learnable parameters.
In our experiments, focused on challenging biomedical image segmentation tasks,
we demonstrate that replacing regular convolutions with hyper-convolutions
leads to more efficient architectures that achieve improved accuracy. Our
analysis also shows that learned hyper-convolutions are naturally regularized,
which can offer better generalization performance. We believe that
hyper-convolutions can be a powerful building block in future neural network
architectures for computer vision tasks. We provide all of our code here:

is that convolution neural networks have too many parameters, which makes it
difficult to analyze them. In this paper, we design and train a convolution

visualization method, the extremum point of the convolution neural network is
projected back to the pixel space of the original image, and we qualitatively
verify that the trained expression recognition convolution neural network forms
a detector for the specific facial action unit. At the same time, we design the
distance function to measure the distance between the presence of facial
feature unit and the maximal value of the response on the feature map of
convolution neural network. The greater the distance, the more sensitive the
feature map is to the facial feature unit. By comparing the maximum distance of
all facial feature elements in the feature graph, the mapping relationship
between facial feature element and convolution neural network feature map is
determined. Therefore, we have verified that the convolution neural network has
formed a detector for the facial Action unit in the training process to realize

neural networks is often high with the deepening of the network and the growth

multiplications, we propose a new type of CNNs called Tropical Convolutional
Neural Networks (TCNNs) which are built on tropical convolutions in which the
multiplications and additions in conventional convolutional layers are replaced
by additions and min/max operations respectively. In addition, since tropical
convolution operators are essentially nonlinear operators, we expect TCNNs to
have higher nonlinear fitting ability than conventional CNNs. In the
experiments, we test and analyze several different architectures of TCNNs for
image classification tasks in comparison with similar-sized conventional CNNs.
The results show that TCNN can achieve higher expressive power than ordinary

combine the activated filter responses to approximate the corresponding
activated filter responses of a standard convolutional layer. The LBC layer
affords significant parameter savings, 9x to 169x in the number of learnable

Abstract      = {Artificial neural networks have recently shown great results in many
disciplines and a variety of applications, including natural language
understanding, speech processing, games and image data generation. One
particular application in which the strong performance of artificial neural
networks was demonstrated is the recognition of objects in images, where deep
convolutional neural networks are commonly applied. In this survey, we give a
comprehensive introduction to this topic (object recognition with deep
convolutional neural networks), with a strong focus on the evolution of network
architectures. Therefore, we aim to compress the most important concepts in
this field in a simple and non-technical manner to allow for future researchers
to have a quick general understanding.
  This work is structured as follows:
  1. We will explain the basic ideas of (convolutional) neural networks and
deep learning and examine their usage for three object recognition tasks: image
classification, object localization and object detection.
  2. We give a review on the evolution of deep convolutional neural networks by
providing an extensive overview of the most important network architectures
presented in chronological order of their appearances.},

Abstract      = {Deep convolutional neural networks are generally regarded as robust function
approximators. So far, this intuition is based on perturbations to external
stimuli such as the images to be classified. Here we explore the robustness of
convolutional neural networks to perturbations to the internal weights and
architecture of the network itself. We show that convolutional networks are
surprisingly robust to a number of internal perturbations in the higher
convolutional layers but the bottom convolutional layers are much more fragile.
For instance, Alexnet shows less than a 30% decrease in classification
performance when randomly removing over 70% of weight connections in the top
convolutional or dense layers but performance is almost at chance with the same
perturbation in the first convolutional layer. Finally, we suggest further
investigations which could continue to inform the robustness of convolutional
networks to internal perturbations.},

PrimaryClass  = {cs.CV},
Abstract      = {Deep convolutional neural networks have demonstrated promising performance on
image classification tasks, but the manual design process becomes more and more
complex due to the fast depth growth and the increasingly complex topologies of
convolutional neural networks. As a result, neural architecture search has
emerged to automatically design convolutional neural networks that outperform
handcrafted counterparts. However, the computational cost is immense, e.g.
22,400 GPU-days and 2,000 GPU-days for two outstanding neural architecture
search works named NAS and NASNet, respectively, which motivates this work. A
new effective and efficient surrogate-assisted particle swarm optimisation
algorithm is proposed to automatically evolve convolutional neural networks.
This is achieved by proposing a novel surrogate model, a new method of creating
a surrogate dataset and a new encoding strategy to encode variable-length
blocks of convolutional neural networks, all of which are integrated into a
particle swarm optimisation algorithm to form the proposed method. The proposed
method shows its effectiveness by achieving competitive error rates of 3.49% on
the CIFAR-10 dataset, 18.49% on the CIFAR-100 dataset, and 1.82% on the SVHN
dataset. The convolutional neural network blocks are efficiently learned by the
proposed method from CIFAR-10 within 3 GPU-days due to the acceleration
achieved by the surrogate model and the surrogate dataset to avoid the training
of 80.1% of convolutional neural network blocks represented by the particles.
Without any further search, the evolved blocks from CIFAR-10 can be
successfully transferred to CIFAR-100 and SVHN, which exhibits the
transferability of the block learned by the proposed method.},

of the proposed model uses mini-epitomes in place of filters and computes
responses invariant to small translations by epitomic search instead of
max-pooling over image positions. The topographic version of the proposed model
uses large epitomes to learn filter maps organized in translational
topographies. We show that error back-propagation can successfully learn
multiple epitomic layers in a supervised fashion. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is assessed in image classification tasks on standard
benchmarks. Our experiments on Imagenet indicate improved recognition

Abstract      = {Depthwise convolution and grouped convolution has been successfully applied
to improve the efficiency of convolutional neural network (CNN). We suggest
that these models can be considered as special cases of a generalized
convolution operation, named channel local convolution(CLC), where an output
channel is computed using a subset of the input channels. This definition
entails computation dependency relations between input and output channels,
which can be represented by a channel dependency graph(CDG). By modifying the
CDG of grouped convolution, a new CLC kernel named interlaced grouped
convolution (IGC) is created. Stacking IGC and GC kernels results in a
convolution block (named CLC Block) for approximating regular convolution. By
resorting to the CDG as an analysis tool, we derive the rule for setting the
meta-parameters of IGC and GC and the framework for minimizing the
computational cost. A new CNN model named clcNet is then constructed using CLC
blocks, which shows significantly higher computational efficiency and fewer
parameters compared to state-of-the-art networks, when being tested using the

by a normal convolutional neural network. The convolutional neural pyramids
extract information from large receptive fields of the depth map and guidance
map, while the convolutional neural network effectively transfers useful
structures of the guidance image to the depth image. Experimental results show
that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms not only on

proposed manner, it is shown that a similar level of classification accuracy
can be achieved, but at a significantly lower cost. The cost reduction is
obtained primarily through the use of fewer weight parameters. Using fewer
weights reduces the number of multiply-accumulate operations and also reduces
the energy required for data accesses. Finally, it is shown that the
effectiveness of the proposed selective deep convolutional neural network can

Abstract      = {Deep convolutional neural networks trained on large datsets have emerged as
an intriguing alternative for compressing images and solving inverse problems
such as denoising and compressive sensing. However, it has only recently been
realized that even without training, convolutional networks can function as
concise image models, and thus regularize inverse problems. In this paper, we
provide further evidence for this finding by studying variations of
convolutional neural networks that map few weight parameters to an image. The
networks we consider only consist of convolutional operations, with either
fixed or parameterized filters followed by ReLU non-linearities. We demonstrate
that with both fixed and parameterized convolutional filters those networks
enable representing images with few coefficients. What is more, the
underparameterization enables regularization of inverse problems, in particular
recovering an image from few observations. We show that, similar to standard
compressive sensing guarantees, on the order of the number of model parameters
many measurements suffice for recovering an image from compressive
measurements. Finally, we demonstrate that signal recovery with a un-trained

Abstract      = {Network in Netwrok (NiN) is an effective instance and an important extension
of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) consisting of alternating convolutional
layers and pooling layers. Instead of using a linear filter for convolution,
NiN utilizes shallow MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP), a nonlinear function, to
replace the linear filter. Because of the powerfulness of MLP and $ 1\times 1 $
convolutions in spatial domain, NiN has stronger ability of feature
representation and hence results in better recognition rate. However, MLP
itself consists of fully connected layers which give rise to a large number of
parameters. In this paper, we propose to replace dense shallow MLP with sparse
shallow MLP. One or more layers of the sparse shallow MLP are sparely connected
in the channel dimension or channel-spatial domain. The proposed method is
implemented by applying unshared convolution across the channel dimension and
applying shared convolution across the spatial dimension in some computational
layers. The proposed method is called CiC. Experimental results on the CIFAR10
dataset, augmented CIFAR10 dataset, and CIFAR100 dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed CiC method.},

Abstract      = {Convolutional neural networks have become a popular research in the field of
finger vein recognition because of their powerful image feature representation.
However, most researchers focus on improving the performance of the network by
increasing the CNN depth and width, which often requires high computational
effort. Moreover, we can notice that not only the importance of pixels in
different channels is different, but also the importance of pixels in different
positions of the same channel is different. To reduce the computational effort
and to take into account the different importance of pixels, we propose a
lightweight convolutional neural network with a convolutional block attention
module (CBAM) for finger vein recognition, which can achieve a more accurate
capture of visual structures through an attention mechanism. First, image
sequences are fed into a lightweight convolutional neural network we designed
to improve visual features. Afterwards, it learns to assign feature weights in
an adaptive manner with the help of a convolutional block attention module. The
experiments are carried out on two publicly available databases and the results
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a stable, highly accurate, and
robust performance in multimodal finger recognition.},

Abstract      = {Convolution has been playing a prominent role in various applications in
science and engineering for many years. It is the most important operation in
convolutional neural networks. There has been a recent growth of interests of
research in generalizing convolutions on curved domains such as manifolds and
graphs. However, existing approaches cannot preserve all the desirable
properties of Euclidean convolutions, namely compactly supported filters,
directionality, transferability across different manifolds. In this paper we
develop a new generalization of the convolution operation, referred to as
parallel transport convolution (PTC), on Riemannian manifolds and their
discrete counterparts. PTC is designed based on the parallel transportation
which is able to translate information along a manifold and to intrinsically
preserve directionality. PTC allows for the construction of compactly supported
filters and is also robust to manifold deformations. This enables us to preform
wavelet-like operations and to define deep convolutional neural networks on
curved domains.},

Abstract      = {Convolutional neural networks are state-of-the-art and ubiquitous in modern
signal processing and machine vision. Nowadays, hardware solutions based on
emerging nanodevices are designed to reduce the power consumption of these
networks. Spintronics devices are promising for information processing because
of the various neural and synaptic functionalities they offer. However, due to
their low OFF/ON ratio, performing all the multiplications required for
convolutions in a single step with a crossbar array of spintronic memories
would cause sneak-path currents. Here we present an architecture where synaptic
communications have a frequency selectivity that prevents crosstalk caused by
sneak-path currents. We first demonstrate how a chain of spintronic resonators
can function as synapses and make convolutions by sequentially rectifying
radio-frequency signals encoding consecutive sets of inputs. We show that a
parallel implementation is possible with multiple chains of spintronic
resonators to avoid storing intermediate computational steps in memory. We
propose two different spatial arrangements for these chains. For each of them,
we explain how to tune many artificial synapses simultaneously, exploiting the
synaptic weight sharing specific to convolutions. We show how information can
be transmitted between convolutional layers by using spintronic oscillators as
artificial microwave neurons. Finally, we simulate a network of these
radio-frequency resonators and spintronic oscillators to solve the MNIST
handwritten digits dataset, and obtain results comparable to software
convolutional neural networks. Since it can run convolutional neural networks
fully in parallel in a single step with nano devices, the architecture proposed
in this paper is promising for embedded applications requiring machine vision,
such as autonomous driving.},

Usage of convolutional neural networks (CNN) is the standard approach to image

paper we propose CNN structure transformation which expresses 2D convolution
filters as a linear combination of separable filters. It allows to obtain
separated convolutional filters by standard training algorithms. We study the
computation efficiency of this structure transformation and suggest fast
implementation easily handled by CPU or GPU. We demonstrate that CNNs designed
for letter and digit recognition of proposed structure show 15% speedup without

by adding well defined layers to an underparameterized DCNN, we can obtain some
interpolating DCNNs that maintain the good learning rates of the
underparameterized DCNN. This result is achieved by a novel network deepening
scheme designed for DCNNs. Our work provides theoretical verification on how

convolutional neural networks can outperform classical model-based techniques,
because they can capture more powerful and discriminative features. However,
since these methods are based on convolutional operations, they are only
capable of exploiting local similarities without taking into account non-local
self-similarities. In this paper we propose a convolutional neural network that
employs graph-convolutional layers in order to exploit both local and non-local
similarities. The graph-convolutional layers dynamically construct
neighborhoods in the feature space to detect latent correlations in the feature
maps produced by the hidden layers. The experimental results show that the
proposed architecture outperforms classical convolutional neural networks for
the denoising task.},
